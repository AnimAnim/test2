21-Feb-2014: May solve my problem with single censuses

mapeoamano.org/en/manuals/how-to-prepare-a-high-resolution-large-format-map-using-google-earth

www.digitalurban.org/2007/10/tutorial-how-to-capture-google-maps-for.html "This tutorial provides a simple method to carry out multiple screen grabs and image stitching to create high resolution output from Google Maps for such purposes."

Issue: What we can get from google maps is an idea of *structures* on the ground. It may not be possible to identify them as individual dwelling units, structures containing dwelling units, perhaps multiple dwelling units, structures with mixed use, etc. Of course it cannot be determined if dwelling units are occupied.

It might be possible to make a list of structures from the map. It will not be possible to make a list of dwelling units. Organizing a walkby of ever structure would be necessary to classify structures as being/containing dwelling units. Apartment buildings pose a problem. The number of dwelling units may be roughly estimated. A query to a building manager, if available, may or may not produce an accuate number. In any case, a walk by of anything but a small area may be problematic. Anything larger than a census EA might require coordinated efforts of multiple field workers.

Principle is that every dwelling unit should have equal probability of selection. Pali's idea of marking off a grid and selecting grid cells, then dwelling units within these cells may be useful. Problem is that selection of grid cells should be proportional to number of included dwelling units, and we can determine this from a map.

Issue of working with local immunization staff or not. Per PES methodology, not working with them avoids biases in the area they know. Probably best not. But maybe they could do legwork on walkbys. But they places they leave out are almost certainly places with lower coverage, risking upward bias in coverage estimates.

Need a graduated approach, best practice, and step by step fall backs, preferably with some idea of the cost in accuracy of the resulting coverage statistic. "helped by local guides" is an invitation to bias.
